_TBA = 'To Be Added'_

**NOTE**: I've been contributing to problems in my college programming contests from first year. Now, after authoring a bunch of problems, I feel that some problems don't really qualify to be in CP contests. They are be less about CP and more about some fancy mathematical thing I discovered back then and found it to be cool enough to put it forward to others.
Though there are a couple of problems that I'm really proud of (like '**Shakespeare and Rangmanch**', '**Snakes in Sabar**' and '**Corona in Karunanagar**'), but if given a chance, I won't choose to attempt most of the other problems here. There are problems out there that present the topics to you in a better manner than these. The process and learning that I've been through while making these problems are what makes them so much more valueable to me. Each problem has with it some learning that helped improve my knowledge about the process and the topic involved in them. However there may be some errors in the problem statement, editorial or testcases that might have missed the testers' and the author's eyes. If you do find any such error, please feel free to open an issue for it.
Thanks
